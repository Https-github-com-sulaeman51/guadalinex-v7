gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.0) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial release, based on the SuSE theme in gfxboot 3.2.5. Notable
    changes from SuSE:
    - Remove "Christmas penguins" theme.
    - Remove driver update disk feature.
    - Remove boot loader splash; usplash should be able to provide
      everything we need along these lines.
    - Remove SuSE-specific images and sounds.
    - Drop back to just 640x480 modes, at least for now.
    - Use "splash.pcx" in the syslinux configuration directory as the
      background image if we find it. We'll use this for alternate
      Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu branding.
    - Interpret a subset of the syslinux simple menu configuration syntax in
      the isolinux configuration file to allow hiding menu items and setting
      human-readable labels.
    - Remove all help texts (which were SuSE-specific anyway); the intent is
      for this to be a generic theme and to put help texts elsewhere,
      probably in debian-installer. Disable the help panel item if no help
      texts are available.
    - Various visual rearrangements.
    - Use the installed version of getx11font rather than that in the
      grandparent directory.
    - Always show the full panel rather than having multiple modes. 
    - Remove bizarre "move down one boot menu option the first time a key is
      pressed" weirdness.
    - Use subtler boot menu selection colours in place of inverse-video.
