    were scary-looking anyway (closes: Ubuntu #21210).

  * Consider bit depth while sorting video modes.
  * Remove duplicates from video mode list (closes: Ubuntu #21578).

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove kroete.dat idle animation, which doesn't fit with the Ubuntu
    theme.

  * Offer normal/expert mode panel option on media other than live CDs.
  * Swap round "VGA" and "Other Options" panel entries.

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make this Architecture: amd64 i386 rather than all, since it depends on
    gfxboot which is only supported on those architectures.

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.0) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial release, based on the SuSE theme in gfxboot 3.2.5. Notable
    changes in this theme versus SuSE:
    - Remove "Christmas penguins" theme.
    - Remove driver update disk feature.
    - Remove boot loader splash; usplash should be able to provide
      everything we need along these lines.
    - Remove SuSE-specific images and sounds.
    - Drop back to just 640x480 modes (with a last-resort fallback to
      640x400x4), at least for now.
    - Use "splash.pcx" in the syslinux configuration directory as the
      background image if we find it. We'll use this for alternate
      Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu branding.
    - Interpret a subset of the syslinux simple menu configuration syntax in
      the isolinux configuration file to allow hiding menu items and setting
      human-readable labels.
    - Remove all help texts (which were SuSE-specific anyway); the intent is
      for this to be a generic theme and to put help texts elsewhere,
      probably in debian-installer. Disable the help panel item if no help
      texts are available.
    - Various visual rearrangements.
    - Use the installed version of getx11font rather than that in the
      grandparent directory.
    - Always show the full panel rather than having multiple modes.
    - Remove bizarre "move down one boot menu option the first time a key is
      pressed" weirdness.
    - Use subtler boot menu selection colours in place of inverse-video.
    - Change the font to GNU unifont, from the unifont package.
    - Update language codes and names from localechooser 0.22ubuntu2.
    - Include /usr/share/gfxboot/themes/Ubuntu/bootlogo.tar.gz, which can be
      unpacked directly into /isolinux on a CD rather than having to unpack
      and repack cpio archives.
    - Avoid mentioning the distribution name in "insert boot disk" messages.
