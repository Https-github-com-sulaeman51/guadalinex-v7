    font (LP: #106074, #195451).

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.5.3) hardy; urgency=low

  * Rename "Start or install $PROJECT" to "Try $PROJECT without any change
    to your computer"; "Install in text mode" to "Install $PROJECT in text
    mode"; "Install to the hard disk" to "Install $PROJECT"; and "Memory
    test" to "Test memory". See
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyBootloaderReview for context.
  * Allow the boot parameters line to occupy the full width of the screen
    (LP: #27676) and handle redraws on language change better.
  * Allow menu options to use more horizontal space, and centre them on the
    screen.
  * Implement "label NAME", "append NAME", "replace NAME", and "applies
    NAME" options in gfxboot.cfg. These are used to implement a new Modes
    menu, which replaces the video menu on F4. The intent is that that this
    should reduce the bewildering array of top-level menu options, while
    still allowing the less usual options to be selected easily. Many
    strings have been changed accordingly.
  * Display a message at the bottom of the menu to indicate that alternative
    modes may be selected using F4.
  * Fix glitch in translate function that sometimes left the original string
    on the stack.

  * Ask for language before displaying the main menu (LP: #39888).
  * Filter out translations for various languages (Arabic, Dzongkha, Indic,
    Mongolian, Thai) that we cannot render properly for various reasons
    (LP: #46985, #56145).
  * Give checkbox semantics to the items in the F6 "Other Options" menu.
  * Add acpi=off, noapic, and nolapic options to the "Other Options" menu.
  * Display the "Other Options" menu for the live CD too, but without the
    d-i expert mode option.
  * Use theme background colour as the colour for dialog title bars and
    progress bars (LP: #28795).
  * Fetch foreground, background, and access-options from gfxboot.cfg in
    preference to isolinux.cfg. The gfxboot-foreground, gfxboot-background,
    and gfxboot-access-options keywords in isolinux.cfg are now deprecated
    and support for them will be removed after Ubuntu 8.04.
  * Include po/ in the binary package for consistency with gfxboot-theme-*,
    although you should generally just use bootlogo.tar.gz rather than
    building the theme afresh (LP: #39930).

  * Update keymaps from console-setup 1.16ubuntu4. Add locale mappings for
    Esperanto and Latvia, tag Lithuania as non-Latin so that the US keymap
    is used for it within gfxboot, and switch France to the oss variant.
  * Add/update translations from Rosetta (LP: #108705).
  * Change "Text mode install for ma^nufacturers" to "^OEM install (for
    manufacturers)", since the OEM install isn't just text mode any more. I
    hope this will still avoid the confusion from bug #95582.

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.3.1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Make numbers used for selecting accessibility menu items consistent even
    if items are omitted from the menu due to GFXBOOT-ACCESS-OPTIONS; so for
    example with "GFXBOOT-ACCESS-OPTIONS v1 v3", pressing "1" would select
    v1, "2" would do nothing, and "3" would select v3. This allows for
    simpler cross-flavour documentation for visually-impaired users.
  * Add "Braille Terminal" entry to accessibility menu (F5, 4), mapped to
    brltty=ask.

  * If available, play startup.mod sound on startup and accessv1.mod (etc.)

    well in tests, so I've left it disabled by not shipping any .mod files.
    Anyone who would like to try to take this from here and figure out
    what's wrong would be welcome.
  * Improve keyboard navigation in accessibility menu: 0 selects None, and
    1, 2, etc. select other menu items in order (closes: Malone #39303).
  * Rename accessibility menu options to describe technology rather than use
    case, per Henrik (closes: Malone #58836).
  * Interpret gfxboot-access-options keyword in isolinux.cfg; for example,
    "v1 v2 m1" enables only the high contrast, magnifier, and keyboard
    modifiers options.
  * Re-enable access=m2 option (now "On-Screen Keyboard") by default.

  * Add/update translations from Rosetta: Afrikaans, Arabic, Belarusian,

    Although it's a bit evil, I've unfuzzied all translations, on the basis

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make this Architecture: amd64 i386 rather than all, since it depends on
    gfxboot which is only supported on those architectures.

gfxboot-theme-ubuntu (0.1.0) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial release, based on the SuSE theme in gfxboot 3.2.5. Notable
    changes in this theme versus SuSE:
    - Remove "Christmas penguins" theme.
    - Remove driver update disk feature.
    - Remove boot loader splash; usplash should be able to provide
      everything we need along these lines.
    - Remove SuSE-specific images and sounds.
    - Drop back to just 640x480 modes (with a last-resort fallback to
      640x400x4), at least for now.
    - Use "splash.pcx" in the syslinux configuration directory as the
      background image if we find it. We'll use this for alternate
      Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu branding.
    - Interpret a subset of the syslinux simple menu configuration syntax in
      the isolinux configuration file to allow hiding menu items and setting
      human-readable labels.
    - Remove all help texts (which were SuSE-specific anyway); the intent is
      for this to be a generic theme and to put help texts elsewhere,
      probably in debian-installer. Disable the help panel item if no help
      texts are available.
    - Various visual rearrangements.
    - Use the installed version of getx11font rather than that in the
      grandparent directory.
    - Always show the full panel rather than having multiple modes.
    - Remove bizarre "move down one boot menu option the first time a key is
      pressed" weirdness.
    - Use subtler boot menu selection colours in place of inverse-video.
    - Change the font to GNU unifont, from the unifont package.
    - Update language codes and names from localechooser 0.22ubuntu2.
    - Include /usr/share/gfxboot/themes/Ubuntu/bootlogo.tar.gz, which can be
      unpacked directly into /isolinux on a CD rather than having to unpack
      and repack cpio archives.
    - Avoid mentioning the distribution name in "insert boot disk" messages.
